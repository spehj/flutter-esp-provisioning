A Flutter Federated Plugin created by SpinDance that wraps the Espressif [Android](https://github.com/espressif/esp-idf-provisioning-android) and [iOS](https://github.com/espressif/esp-idf-provisioning-ios) Wi-Fi provisioning libraries.

IMPORTANT!
This plugin only supports Espressif BLE devices running [Protocomm Security 1](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/stable/esp32/api-reference/provisioning/protocomm.html).

To be clear, this plugin does not (yet) support:

- Espressif Protocomm Security0 devices
- Espressif Protocomm Security1 devices
- Espressif SoftAP devices
